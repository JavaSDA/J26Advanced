Create a class called person:
- firstName
- lastName
- age

Encapsulate the person class such that once an
instance of it is created it cannot be changed but
values can be read from it.

Create another class called Employee:
- occupation
- employeeId

Ensure that the Employee class is a child class
to the Person class.
